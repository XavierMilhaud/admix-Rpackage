#' Hypothesis test between unknown components of the admixture models under study
#'
#' Perform hypothesis test between unknown components of a list of admixture models, where we remind that the i-th admixture
#' model has probability density function (pdf) l_i such that:
#'    l_i = p_i * f_i + (1-p_i) * g_i, with g_i the known component density.
#' The unknown quantities p_i and f_i are thus estimated, leading to the test given by the following null and alternative hypothesis:
#' H0: f_i = f_j for all i != j   against H1 : there exists at least i != j such that f_i differs from f_j.
#' The test can be performed using two methods, either the comparison of coefficients obtained through polynomial basis expansions
#' of the component densities, or by the inner-convergence property obtained using the IBM approach. See 'Details' below for further information.
#'
#' @param samples A list of the K samples to be studied, all following admixture distributions.
#' @param sym.f A boolean indicating whether the unknown component densities are assumed to be symmetric or not.
#' @param test.method The testing method to be applied. Can be either 'Poly' (polynomial basis expansion) or 'ICV' (inner
#'                    convergence from IBM). The same testing method is performed between all samples. In the one-sample case,
#'                    only 'Poly' is available and the test is a gaussianity test. For further details, see section 'Details' below.
#' @param sim_U (Used only with 'ICV' testing method, otherwise useless) Random draws of the inner convergence part of the contrast
#'               as defined in the IBM approach (see 'Details' below).
#' @param n_sim_tab (Used only with 'ICV' testing method, otherwise useless) Number of simulated gaussian processes used in the
#'                   tabulation of the inner convergence distribution in the IBM approach.
#' @param comp.dist A list with 2*K elements corresponding to the component distributions (specified with R native names for these distributions)
#'                  involved in the K admixture models. Elements, grouped by 2, refer to the unknown and known components of each admixture model,
#'                  If there are unknown elements, they must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance, 'comp.dist' could be specified
#'                  as follows with K = 3: list(f1 = NULL, g1 = 'norm', f2 = NULL, g2 = 'norm', f3 = NULL, g3 = 'rnorm').
#' @param comp.param A list with 2*K elements corresponding to the parameters of the component distributions, each element being a list
#'                   itself. The names used in this list must correspond to the native R argument names for these distributions.
#'                   Elements, grouped by 2, refer to the parameters of unknown and known components of each admixture model.
#'                   If there are unknown elements, they must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance, 'comp.param' could
#'                   be specified as follows (with K = 3):
#'                   list(f1 = NULL, g1 = list(mean=0,sd=1), f2 = NULL, g2 = list(mean=3,sd=1.1), f3 = NULL, g3 = list(mean=-2,sd=0.6)).
#' @param support (Potentially used with 'Poly' testing method, otherwise useless) The support of the observations; one of "Real",
#'                 "Integer", "Positive", or "Bounded.continuous".
#' @param ICV_tunePenalty (default to TRUE) Boolean used to tune the penalty term in the k-sample test (k=2,3,...,K) when using Inversion
#'                        Best Matching (IBM) approach coupled to Inner ConVergence (ICV) property. Particularly useful when studying
#'                        unbalanced samples (in terms of sample size) or small-sized samples.
#' @param conf.level The confidence level of the K-sample test.
#' @param parallel (default to FALSE) Boolean indicating whether parallel computations are performed (speed-up the tabulation).
#' @param n_cpu (default to 2) Number of cores used when parallelizing.
#'
#' @details For further details on hypothesis techniques, see i) Inner convergence through IBM approach at
#'          https://hal.science/hal-03201760 ; ii) Polynomial expansions at 'False Discovery Rate model
#'          Gaussianity test' (EJS, Pommeret & Vanderkerkhove, 2017), or 'Semiparametric two-sample admixture components comparison test:
#'          the symmetric case' (JSPI, Milhaud & al., 2021).
#'
#' @return A list containing the decision of the test (reject or not), the confidence level at which the test is performed,
#'         the p-value of the test, and the value of the test statistic (following a chi2 distribution with one degree of freedom
#'         under the null).
