#' Equality test for the unknown components of admixture models
#'
#' Perform hypothesis test between unknown components of a list of admixture models, where we remind that the i-th admixture
#' model has probability density function (pdf) l_i such that:
#'    l_i = p_i * f_i + (1-p_i) * g_i, with g_i the known component density.
#' The unknown quantities p_i and f_i are thus estimated, leading to the test given by the following null and alternative hypothesis:
#' H0: f_i = f_j for all i != j   against H1 : there exists at least i != j such that f_i differs from f_j.
#' The test can be performed using two methods, either the comparison of coefficients obtained through polynomial basis expansions
#' of the component densities, or by the inner-convergence property obtained using the IBM approach. See 'Details' below for further information.
#'
#' @param samples A list of the K (K > 0) samples to be studied, each one assumed to follow a mixture distribution.
#' @param admixMod A list of objects of class \link[admix]{admix_model}, containing useful information about distributions and parameters
#'                 of the contamination / admixture models under study.
#' @param test_method The testing method to be applied. Can be either 'poly' (polynomial basis expansion) or 'icv' (inner
#'                    convergence from IBM). The same testing method is performed between all samples. In the one-sample case,
#'                    only 'poly' is available and the test is a gaussianity test. For further details, see section 'Details' below.
#' @param conf_level The confidence level of the K-sample test.
#' @param ... Depending on the choice made by the user for the test method ('poly' or 'icv'), optional arguments to
#'            \link[admix]{gaussianity_test} or \link[admix]{orthobasis_test} (in case of 'poly'), and to \link[admix]{IBM_k_samples_test}
#'            in case of 'icv'.

#' @return An object of class 'htest' containing the classical attributes of the latter class, as well as
#'         other attributes specific to the inherited object class. Usually, the test decision (reject the null hypothesis or not);
#'         the confidence level of the test (1-alpha, where alpha denotes the level of the test or equivalently the type-I error);
#'         the number of samples under study; the respective size of each sample; the information about known mixture components.
