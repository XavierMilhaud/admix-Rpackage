\title{Clustering of K populations following admixture models}
\usage{
admix_clustering(
  samples = NULL,
  n_sim_tab = 100,
  comp.dist = NULL,
  comp.param = NULL,
  tabul.dist = NULL,
  tune.penalty = FALSE,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  parallel = FALSE,
  n_cpu = 2,
  echo = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A list of the K observed samples to be clustered, all following admixture distributions.}

\item{n_sim_tab}{Number of simulated gaussian processes used in the tabulation of the inner convergence distribution in the IBM approach.}

\item{comp.dist}{A list with 2*K elements corresponding to the component distributions (specified with R native names for these distributions)
involved in the K admixture models. Elements, grouped by 2, refer to the unknown and known components of each admixture model,
If there are unknown elements, they must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance, 'comp.dist' could be specified
as follows with K = 3: list(f1 = NULL, g1 = 'norm', f2 = NULL, g2 = 'norm', f3 = NULL, g3 = 'rnorm').}

\item{comp.param}{A list with 2*K elements corresponding to the parameters of the component distributions, each element being a list
itself. The names used in this list must correspond to the native R argument names for these distributions.
Elements, grouped by 2, refer to the parameters of unknown and known components of each admixture model.
If there are unknown elements, they must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance, 'comp.param' could
be specified as follows (with K = 3):
list(f1 = NULL, g1 = list(mean=0,sd=1), f2 = NULL, g2 = list(mean=3,sd=1.1), f3 = NULL, g3 = list(mean=-2,sd=0.6)).}

\item{tabul.dist}{Only useful for comparisons of detected clusters at different confidence levels. Is a list of the tabulated distributions
of the stochastic integral for each cluster previously detected.}

\item{tune.penalty}{A boolean that allows to choose between a classical penalty term or an optimized penalty embedding some tuning parameters
(automatically optimized) for k-sample tests used within the clustering procedure.
Optimized penalty is particularly useful for low sample size.}

\item{conf.level}{The confidence level of the K-sample test used in the clustering procedure.}

\item{parallel}{(default to FALSE) Boolean to indicate whether parallel computations are performed (speed-up the tabulation).}

\item{n_cpu}{(default to 2) Number of cores used when parallelizing.}

\item{echo}{(default to TRUE) Display the remaining computation time.}
}
\value{
A list with eleven elements: 1) the number of populations studied; 2) the number of detected clusters;
3) the list of p-values for each test performed; 4) the cluster affiliation for each population; 5) the chosen confidence
level of statistical tests; 6) the cluster components; 7) the size of clusters; 8) the estimated weights of the unknown
component distributions inside each cluster (remind that estimated weights are consistent only if unknown components are tested
to be identical); 9) the matrix of pairwise discrepancies across populations; 10) the tabulated distributions used for
statistical tests; 11) the initial call.
}
\description{
Create clusters on the unknown components related to the K populations following admixture models. Based on the K-sample test
using Inversion - Best Matching (IBM) approach, see 'Details' below for further information.

## Simulate data (chosen parameters indicate 2 clusters (populations (1,3), and (2,4)):
list.comp <- list(f1 = "gamma", g1 = "exp",
                  f2 = "gamma", g2 = "exp",
                  f3 = "gamma", g3 = "gamma",
                  f4 = "gamma", g4 = "exp")
list.param <- list(f1 = list(shape = 16, rate = 4), g1 = list(rate = 1/3.5),
                   f2 = list(shape = 14, rate = 2), g2 = list(rate = 1/5),
                   f3 = list(shape = 16, rate = 4), g3 = list(shape = 12, rate = 2),
                   f4 = list(shape = 14, rate = 2), g4 = list(rate = 1/7))
A.sim <- rsimmix(n=2600, unknownComp_weight=0.8, comp.dist = list(list.comp$f1,list.comp$g1),
                 comp.param = list(list.param$f1, list.param$g1))$mixt.data
B.sim <- rsimmix(n=3000, unknownComp_weight=0.7, comp.dist = list(list.comp$f2,list.comp$g2),
                 comp.param = list(list.param$f2, list.param$g2))$mixt.data
C.sim <- rsimmix(n=3500, unknownComp_weight=0.6, comp.dist = list(list.comp$f3,list.comp$g3),
                 comp.param = list(list.param$f3, list.param$g3))$mixt.data
D.sim <- rsimmix(n=4800, unknownComp_weight=0.5, comp.dist = list(list.comp$f4,list.comp$g4),
                 comp.param = list(list.param$f4, list.param$g4))$mixt.data
## Look for the clusters:
list.comp <- list(f1 = NULL, g1 = "exp",
                  f2 = NULL, g2 = "exp",
                  f3 = NULL, g3 = "gamma",
                  f4 = NULL, g4 = "exp")
list.param <- list(f1 = NULL, g1 = list(rate = 1/3.5),
                   f2 = NULL, g2 = list(rate = 1/5),
                   f3 = NULL, g3 = list(shape = 12, rate = 2),
                   f4 = NULL, g4 = list(rate = 1/7))
clusters <- admix_clustering(samples = list(A.sim,B.sim,C.sim,D.sim), n_sim_tab = 30,
                             comp.dist = list.comp, comp.param = list.param,
                             tabul.dist = NULL, tune.penalty = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95,
                             parallel = TRUE, n_cpu = 2, echo = FALSE)
