\title{Gaussianity test in an admixture model}
\usage{
gaussianity_test(
  sample1,
  comp.dist,
  comp.param,
  K = 3,
  lambda = 0.2,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  support = c("Real", "Integer", "Positive", "Bounded.continuous")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample1}{Observed sample with mixture distribution given by l = p*f + (1-p)*g, where f and p are unknown and g is known.}

\item{comp.dist}{List with two elements corresponding to the component distributions involved in the admixture model. Unknown
elements must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance if 'f' is unknown: list(f = NULL, g = 'norm').}

\item{comp.param}{List with two elements corresponding to the parameters of the component distributions, each element being a list
itself. The names used in this list must correspond to the native R names for distributions.
Unknown elements must be specified as 'NULL' objects (e.g. if 'f' is unknown: list(f=NULL, g=list(mean=0,sd=1)).}

\item{K}{Number of coefficients considered for the polynomial basis expansion.}

\item{lambda}{Rate at which the normalization factor is set in the penalization rule for model selection (in ]0,1/2[). See 'Details' below.}

\item{conf.level}{The confidence level, default to 95 percent. Equals 1-alpha, where alpha is the level of the test (type-I error).}

\item{support}{Support of the densities under consideration, useful to choose the polynomial orthonormal basis. One of 'Real',
'Integer', 'Positive', or 'Bounded.continuous'.}
}
\value{
A list of 6 elements, containing: 1) the rejection decision; 2) the p-value of the test; 3) the test statistic; 4) the
variance-covariance matrix of the test statistic; 5) the selected rank for testing; and 6) a list of the estimates
(unknown component weight 'p', shift location parameter 'mu' and standard deviation 's' of the symmetric unknown distribution).
}
\description{
Performs an hypothesis test to check for the gaussianity of the unknown mixture component, given that the known component
has support on the real line. Recall that an admixture model has probability density function (pdf) l = p*f + (1-p)*g, where g is
the known pdf and l is observed (others are unknown). Requires optimization (to estimate the unknown parameters) as defined
by Bordes & Vandekerkhove (2010), which means that the unknown mixture component must have a symmetric density.
}
\details{
Extensions to the case of non-gaussian known components can be overcome thanks to basic transformations using cdf.

\examples{
####### Under the null hypothesis H0.
## Parameters of the gaussian distribution to be tested:
list.comp <- list(f = "norm", g = "norm")
list.param <- list(f = c(mean = 2, sd = 0.5),
                   g = c(mean = 0, sd = 1))
## Simulate and plot the data at hand:
obs.data <- rsimmix(n = 150, unknownComp_weight = 0.9, comp.dist = list.comp,
                    comp.param = list.param)[['mixt.data']]
plot(density(obs.data))
## Performs the test:
list.comp <- list(f = NULL, g = "norm")
list.param <- list(f = NULL, g = c(mean = 0, sd = 1))
gaussianity_test(sample1 = obs.data, comp.dist = list.comp, comp.param = list.param,
                 K = 3, lambda = 0.1, conf.level = 0.95, support = 'Real')
