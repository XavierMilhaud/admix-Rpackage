\title{Estimate the unknown parameters of the admixture model(s)}
\usage{
admix_estim(
  samples = NULL,
  sym.f = FALSE,
  est.method = c("PS", "BVdk", "IBM"),
  comp.dist = NULL,
  comp.param = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A list of the K samples to be studied, all following admixture distributions.}

\item{sym.f}{A boolean indicating whether the unknown component densities are assumed to be symmetric or not.}

\item{est.method}{The estimation method to be applied. Can be one of 'BVdk' (Bordes and Vandekerkhove estimator), 'PS' (Patra and Sen
estimator), or 'IBM' (Inversion Best-Matching approach). The same estimation method is performed on each sample.
Important note: estimation by 'IBM' is unbiased only under H0, meaning that choosing this method requires to perform
previously the test hypothesis between the pairs of samples. For further details, see section 'Details' below.}

\item{comp.dist}{A list with 2*K elements corresponding to the component distributions (specified with R native names for these distributions)
involved in the K admixture models. Elements, grouped by 2, refer to the unknown and known components of each admixture model,
If there are unknown elements, they must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance, 'comp.dist' could be specified
as follows with K = 3: list(f1 = NULL, g1 = 'norm', f2 = NULL, g2 = 'norm', f3 = NULL, g3 = 'norm').}

\item{comp.param}{A list with 2*K elements corresponding to the parameters of the component distributions, each element being a list
itself. The names used in this list must correspond to the native R argument names for these distributions.
Elements, grouped by 2, refer to the parameters of unknown and known components of each admixture model.
If there are unknown elements, they must be specified as 'NULL' objects. For instance, 'comp.param' could
be specified as follows (with K = 3):
list(f1 = NULL, g1 = list(mean=0,sd=1), f2 = NULL, g2 = list(mean=3,sd=1.1), f3 = NULL, g3 = list(mean=-2,sd=0.6)).}
}
\value{
A list containing the estimated weight of every unknown component distribution among admixture samples.
}
\description{
Estimate the component weights, the location shift parameter (in case of a symmetric unknown component density),
and the unknown component distribution using different estimation techniques. We remind that the i-th admixture
model has probability density function (pdf) l_i such that:
l_i = p_i * f_i + (1-p_i) * g_i, where g_i is the known component density.
The unknown quantities p_i and f_i then have to be estimated.

ii) BVdk estimator ; iii) IBM approach.

\examples{
##### On a simulated example to see whether the true parameters are well estimated.
list.comp <- list(f1 = "norm", g1 = "norm",
                  f2 = "norm", g2 = "norm")
list.param <- list(f1 = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), g1 = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.7),
                   f2 = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), g2 = list(mean = -3, sd = 1.1))
## Simulate data:
sim1 <- rsimmix(n = 2100, unknownComp_weight = 0.8, comp.dist = list(list.comp$f1,list.comp$g1),
                comp.param = list(list.param$f1, list.param$g1))$mixt.data
sim2 <- rsimmix(n= 2000, unknownComp_weight = 0.85, comp.dist = list(list.comp$f2,list.comp$g2),
                comp.param = list(list.param$f2, list.param$g2))$mixt.data
## Estimate the mixture weights of the admixture models:
list.comp <- list(f1 = NULL, g1 = "norm",
                  f2 = NULL, g2 = "norm")
list.param <- list(f1 = NULL, g1 = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.7),
                   f2 = NULL, g2 = list(mean = -3, sd = 1.1))
estim <- admix_estim(samples = list(sim1,sim2), sym.f = TRUE, est.method = 'IBM',
                     comp.dist = list.comp, comp.param = list.param)
